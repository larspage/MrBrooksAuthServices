# 9. Testing Strategy

## Test-Driven Development
Adopt TDD to ensure robust, maintainable code, particularly for critical components.

- **Approach**: Write tests before implementation for authentication, payment, and core logic to catch issues early.
- **Test Coverage**: Target at least 80% coverage for core functionality, measured with tools like Istanbul.
- **Testing Pyramid**: Emphasize unit tests (70%), followed by integration (20%), and E2E (10%) for efficient testing.
- **Additional Details**: Integrate TDD into the workflow with red-green-refactor cycles. Use mocking for dependencies to isolate tests.

## Testing Types and Frameworks
Comprehensive testing across types ensures reliability.

- **Unit Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library for isolated component and function tests.
- **Integration Testing**: Supertest for API endpoint testing, verifying interactions between modules.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Playwright for simulating user journeys across browsers and devices.
- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning, including auth bypass and injection tests.
- **Additional Details**: Include performance tests with tools like Artillery. Automate regression tests for all types.

## Testing Environments
Multiple environments support thorough testing.

- **Local Development**: Use Docker Compose for consistent, isolated testing setups.
- **Staging Environment**: Mirror production for integration and user acceptance testing.
- **Automated Testing**: GitHub Actions for CI pipelines running on every commit/PR.
- **Manual Testing**: Conduct UAT for critical flows, with checklists for exploratory testing.
- **Additional Details**: Implement canary testing in production. Use environment-specific configs to avoid data pollution.

This strategy ensures high-quality code through systematic testing, reducing bugs and improving reliability.

## Modular Development Breakdown
Modular tasks for implementing the testing strategy, with checkboxes for tracking.

### TDD Setup Tasks
- [ ] Configure Jest and testing libraries in the project.
- [ ] Write initial TDD examples for auth functions.
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting and thresholds.

### Testing Types Tasks
- [ ] Implement unit tests for key components.
- [ ] Create integration tests for API routes.
- [ ] Develop E2E tests for user flows.
- [ ] Integrate security scanning tools.

### Environment Tasks
- [ ] Set up Docker for local testing.
- [ ] Configure staging environment mirroring.
- [ ] Build CI/CD pipelines for automated tests.
- [ ] Create UAT checklists and procedures.

Update this checklist as testing is implemented.
