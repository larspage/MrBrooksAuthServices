# 16. Success Metrics and Monitoring

## Key Performance Indicators
Technical KPIs to measure system performance.

- **Authentication Success Rate**: Target >99.5% successful logins, monitored via error logs.
- **Payment Success Rate**: Aim for >98% successful transactions, tracking failures and retries.
- **User Conversion Rate**: Measure sign-up to subscription conversions, establishing baselines for improvement.
- **System Uptime**: Goal of >99.9% availability, using monitoring tools to track downtime.
- **Response Time**: <200ms for auth, <500ms for APIs, averaged over requests.
- **Additional Details**: Set alerts for deviations. Use dashboards for real-time viewing.

## Business Metrics
Metrics focused on business growth and user engagement.

- **User Acquisition**: Track new registrations and growth rates monthly.
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor MRR, ARR, and average revenue per user (ARPU).
- **Churn Rate**: Calculate monthly churn, aiming for <5%, with reasons analysis.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Estimate long-term value based on subscription data.
- **Additional Details**: Segment by application or tier. Integrate with analytics tools for insights.

## Technical Metrics
Operational metrics for system health.

- **Error Rates**: Monitor application and API errors, targeting <1% error rate.
- **Database Performance**: Track query times and optimize slow queries (>100ms).
- **Security Incidents**: Count failed auth attempts and breaches, with immediate alerts.
- **Integration Success**: Measure successful app integrations and API call success rates.
- **Additional Details**: Use logging for detailed analysis. Set benchmarks for scaling decisions.

This section defines metrics for evaluating success and guiding improvements.
