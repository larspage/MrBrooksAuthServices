# 17. Risk Management and Mitigation

## Technical Risks
Identify and mitigate technical challenges.

- **Supabase Dependency**: Risk of vendor lock-in or service outages; mitigate with regular backups and multi-vendor evaluation.
- **Payment Processing**: Potential for transaction failures or fraud; use Stripe's fraud tools and implement redundant payment gateways.
- **Data Loss**: From hardware failure or errors; employ daily backups, replication, and point-in-time recovery.
- **Security Breaches**: Hacking or data leaks; conduct regular audits, use encryption, and have incident response plans.
- **Additional Details**: Prioritize risks by likelihood and impact. Update risk register quarterly.

## Business Risks
Address business-related uncertainties.

- **Single Point of Failure**: Reliance on sole owner; document processes for continuity and consider insurance.
- **Scaling Challenges**: High traffic overload; design for horizontal scaling and monitor usage patterns.
- **Compliance Issues**: Regulatory changes or violations; stay updated via legal subscriptions and annual reviews.
- **Integration Complexity**: Difficulties for AI systems; provide detailed docs and support channels.
- **Additional Details**: Conduct SWOT analysis. Develop contingency plans for each risk.

## Mitigation Strategies
General strategies to reduce risks.

- **Redundancy**: Multi-region deployments and backup systems for high availability.
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive alerting for technical and business metrics.
- **Documentation**: Detailed guides for operations, troubleshooting, and recovery.
- **Testing**: Include disaster recovery scenarios in testing plans.
- **Additional Details**: Assign risk owners and review mitigation effectiveness regularly.
