# 12. Integration SDK and Developer Experience

## SDK Development
Provide a robust SDK to simplify integration for applications.

- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with web frameworks like React and Next.js.
- **Features**:
  - Authentication state management with hooks for login status.
  - Automatic token refresh and error handling.
  - Membership status checking and feature gating utilities.
  - Payment integration helpers for initiating subscriptions.
- **Distribution**: Publish as an NPM package with semantic versioning and changelog.
- **Additional Details**: Include type definitions for IDE autocompletion. Support both client-side and server-side usage.

## Integration Process
Streamlined steps for developers to integrate the service.

1. **Application Registration**: Use admin portal to register app and generate API keys.
2. **SDK Installation**: Run `npm install @mrbrooks/auth-sdk`.
3. **Configuration**: Set environment variables for API keys and endpoints.
4. **Route Protection**: Apply middleware to protect routes based on auth status.
5. **Membership Checks**: Use SDK functions to control access to features.
- **Additional Details**: Provide code snippets for each step. Include debugging tips and common pitfalls.

## Code Generation
Tools to automate code creation for consistency.

- **Boilerplate Templates**: Pre-built code for common integrations like login forms or subscription buttons.
- **Configuration Files**: Auto-generate config based on admin portal settings, e.g., JSON files for tiers.
- **Migration Scripts**: Scripts to sync configurations across environments.
- **Additional Details**: Use templates in Handlebars or similar for customization. Integrate with AI tools for dynamic generation.

This section focuses on developer-friendly tools to ease integration and enhance experience.
