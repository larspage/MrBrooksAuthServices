# 4. Technical Architecture

## Technology Stack

The technology stack is chosen for its robustness, ease of integration, and suitability for AI-assisted development. It emphasizes modern, scalable tools with strong community support.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (React-based framework with excellent Supabase integration, server-side rendering, and API routes).
- **Alternative Consideration**: Evaluate SvelteKit or Nuxt.js if they offer superior AI-friendly documentation or performance benefits.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, enabling rapid prototyping and consistent design.
- **State Management**: Utilize built-in React hooks and context API, supplemented by Supabase real-time subscriptions for dynamic data.
- **Additional Details**: Include TypeScript for type safety. Use component libraries like Headless UI for accessible UI elements.

### Backend
- **Primary Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL-based with built-in authentication, real-time capabilities, and Row Level Security).
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth supporting multiple providers (email, social, OAuth).
- **APIs**: Leverage Supabase's built-in RESTful APIs, extended with custom Edge Functions or serverless endpoints where needed.
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe API for billing, webhooks, and subscription management.
- **Real-time Features**: Supabase Realtime for live updates on memberships and sessions.
- **Additional Details**: Use Node.js for any custom backend logic, ensuring serverless deployment compatibility.

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: DigitalOcean App Platform for scalable, managed hosting.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions integrated with DigitalOcean for automated builds and deployments.
- **Environment Management**: Separate environments for development, staging, and production with configuration variables.
- **SSL/Security**: Automatic SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt, with renewal automation.
- **Additional Details**: Implement monitoring with DigitalOcean's tools and external services like Sentry for error tracking.

## Architecture Patterns

### Multi-Tenancy Strategy
- **Approach**: Shared database schema with strict isolation using Row Level Security (RLS).
- **Tenant Identification**: Use an `application_id` field in all relevant tables to segregate data.
- **Data Isolation**: Enforce RLS policies to ensure applications access only their data.
- **Benefits**: Reduces costs, simplifies maintenance, and enables easy cross-tenant analytics for admins.
- **Additional Details**: Include database triggers for automatic tenant assignment and auditing.

### API Security
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens issued by Supabase, validated on each request.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with per-application permissions.
- **Encryption**: Mandatory HTTPS/TLS for all communications, with data encryption at rest.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement at the API level to prevent abuse, using tools like nginx or Supabase edges.
- **Additional Details**: Use refresh tokens with rotation and short-lived access tokens. Include CORS policies for secure cross-origin requests.

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Target < 200ms for authentication requests, < 500ms for other API calls.
- **Availability**: Aim for 99.9% uptime with redundancy and failover mechanisms.
- **Scalability**: Design to handle 10,000+ concurrent users, using horizontal scaling and caching.
- **Database Performance**: Optimize with indexes, query planning, and connection pooling.
- **Additional Details**: Implement caching layers (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data. Monitor with tools to identify bottlenecks.

This section outlines the technical foundation, ensuring a scalable, secure architecture aligned with project goals.
