# 3. Core Functionality

## Priority-Ranked Features

The core functionality is prioritized to ensure a logical development progression, starting with essential authentication and building toward comprehensive management features. Each priority level includes detailed requirements to guide implementation.

### Priority 1: Core Authentication Service
This forms the foundation of the service, handling user identity securely.
- User registration and login supporting multiple methods (email/password, social logins, magic links).
- Secure session management utilizing Supabase Auth for token issuance and validation.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support, including TOTP and biometric options where applicable.
- Password reset and account recovery processes with email verification and security questions.
- Additional Details: Implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks. Ensure all authentication endpoints are protected against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.

### Priority 2: Multi-Application Authorization
Enables secure access control across integrated applications.
- Application-specific access control lists (ACLs).
- Role-based permissions configurable per application.
- Secure API communication using HTTPS and encrypted channels.
- JWT token management, including issuance, validation, and revocation.
- Additional Details: Tokens should have short expiration times with refresh mechanisms. Include claims for application-specific roles and permissions.

### Priority 3: Membership Management System
Manages user memberships across applications with flexibility.
- Multiple membership tiers per application, with customizable features.
- Cross-application membership bundles for combined access.
- Flexible naming and configuration of memberships per application.
- Simultaneous user management across multiple applications.
- Additional Details: Support for upgrading/downgrading tiers with immediate effect. Include analytics on membership distribution.

### Priority 4: Subscription and Payment Processing
Handles billing and payments integration.
- Stripe integration for secure payment processing.
- Automatic recurring billing with monthly and yearly options.
- Proration calculations for mid-cycle changes.
- Handling of failed payments with retries and notifications.
- Invoice generation, including tax calculations and PDF exports.
- Additional Details: Integrate webhooks for real-time payment status updates. Support multiple currencies and payment methods.

### Priority 5: Admin Portal
Provides tools for system oversight and configuration.
- Application registration and detailed configuration options.
- Management of membership tiers and pricing structures.
- Comprehensive user oversight across all integrated applications.
- Analytics dashboards for revenue and usage reporting.
- Migration tools for promoting configurations from dev to production.
- Additional Details: Include search and filter capabilities for users and applications. Implement export functions for data backups.

## Essential User Flows

These flows outline key interactions, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### User Registration/Login Flow
1. User accesses an integrated application.
2. Redirect to MrBrooksAuthService for authentication.
3. Select authentication method (e.g., email/password, social login).
4. Upon success, redirect back with a valid session token.
5. Application validates the session and grants access.
- Additional Details: Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid credentials or network issues, with user-friendly messages.

### Subscription Management Flow
1. User selects a membership tier in the application.
2. Redirect to secure Stripe payment page.
3. Confirm payment to activate membership.
4. Grant immediate access to features.
5. Set up recurring billing.
- Additional Details: Provide confirmation emails and allow users to manage subscriptions via a self-service portal.

### Admin Application Setup Flow
1. Admin logs into the portal.
2. Register new application with details.
3. Generate API keys and access documentation.
4. Configure tiers and pricing.
5. Test in development environment.
6. Migrate to production using scripts.
- Additional Details: Include validation steps to ensure configurations are complete before migration.

This section details the core features and flows, serving as a blueprint for functional implementation.
