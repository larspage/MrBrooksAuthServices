# MrBrooksAuthService - Product Development Requirements (PDR)

## 1. Project Overview

### Project Name
MrBrooksAuthService

### Project Description
A standalone, multi-tenant authentication and subscription management service that provides centralized user authentication, authorization, and membership management for a suite of SaaS applications under Mr Brooks LLC. The service leverages Supabase for authentication and database management, integrates with Stripe for payment processing, and provides a comprehensive admin portal for managing applications, membership tiers, and pricing across multiple products.

### Problem Statement

4. Successful authentication redirects back to application with valid session
5. Application validates session and grants appropriate access

#### Subscription Management Flow
1. User selects membership tier within an application
2. Redirected to secure payment processing via Stripe
3. Payment confirmation creates active membership
4. User gains immediate access to tier-appropriate features
5. Automatic billing continues per selected schedule

#### Admin Application Setup Flow
1. Admin accesses admin portal
2. Registers new application with configuration details
3. Receives API keys and integration documentation
4. Configures membership tiers and pricing for the application
5. Tests integration in development environment
6. Migrates configuration to production using provided scripts

## 4. Technical Architecture
