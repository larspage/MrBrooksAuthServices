# 13. Data Migration and Environment Management

## Migration Strategy
Strategies to ensure smooth transitions between environments with minimal downtime.

- **Code Deployment**: Use GitHub Actions to automate builds and deployments to DigitalOcean App Platform.
- **Database Migrations**: Leverage Supabase's built-in migration tools, supplemented with custom SQL scripts for complex changes.
- **Configuration Migration**: Develop scripts to export/import settings like API keys and app configs.
- **Data Transformation**: Implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts for data format updates or schema evolutions.
- **Additional Details**: Include dry-run modes for migrations to preview changes. Ensure all migrations are idempotent for safe re-runs.

## Migration Scripts Required
Essential scripts for key migration tasks.

1. **Application Configuration Migration**: Scripts to serialize and transfer app settings, handling JSONB fields.
2. **Membership Tier Migration**: Transfer tier definitions, features, and pricing, preserving relationships.
3. **User Data Migration**: Securely move user profiles and memberships, with anonymization options for testing.
4. **Stripe Configuration Sync**: Sync products, prices, and webhooks between Stripe environments.
- **Additional Details**: Version scripts and include logging for audit trails. Test scripts in isolation before full use.

## Environment Promotion Process
Structured process for promoting changes.

1. **Development → Staging**: Automated via GitHub Actions on merge to staging branch.
2. **Staging → Production**: Require manual approval, then automate execution with monitoring.
3. **Rollback Procedures**: Maintain backups and scripts for quick reversion to previous states.
4. **Data Validation**: Run post-migration checks to verify data integrity and consistency.
- **Additional Details**: Include notifications for promotion status. Use feature flags for gradual rollouts.

This section provides guidelines for managing migrations and environments, ensuring reliability.
