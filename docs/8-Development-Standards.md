# 8. Development Standards

## Coding Standards
These standards ensure code quality, maintainability, and ease of collaboration, particularly for AI-assisted development.

- **Language**: TypeScript for enhanced type safety, better error detection, and improved AI code generation capabilities.
- **Linting**: ESLint configured with Prettier for consistent code formatting, including rules for accessibility and best practices.
- **File Structure**: Organize by features (e.g., auth/, subscriptions/) with separation of concerns (components, services, utils).
- **Component Architecture**: Build reusable React components with defined prop types/interfaces, following atomic design principles.
- **API Design**: Adhere to RESTful principles, with endpoints documented via OpenAPI/Swagger for automatic client generation.
- **Additional Details**: Enforce naming conventions (e.g., PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables). Use barrel files for exports to simplify imports.

## Development Methodology
An agile approach facilitates iterative development and quick adaptations.

- **Approach**: Agile with 2-week sprints, including daily stand-ups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives.
- **Version Control**: Git using feature branch workflow (e.g., git-flow), with descriptive commit messages and pull requests.
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory reviews for all merges to main, using tools like GitHub PRs with at least one approver.
- **Documentation**: Maintain inline comments and separate docs for complex logic; update with every change.
- **Additional Details**: Incorporate continuous integration for automated checks. Use project management tools like Jira or Trello for task tracking.

## Documentation Requirements
Comprehensive documentation supports developers and AI systems.

- **Code Documentation**: Use JSDoc for functions, components, and types, generating HTML docs automatically.
- **API Documentation**: Full OpenAPI 3.0 specs, hosted with Swagger UI for interactive testing.
- **Integration Guide**: Step-by-step guides for integrating applications, including code snippets and diagrams.
- **Migration Scripts**: Detailed procedures with scripts for promoting changes between environments.
- **Additional Details**: Version documentation with releases. Include changelogs and contribution guidelines.

## AI Development Documentation
A non-public package tailored for AI systems to streamline integration and code generation.

- **Quick Start Guide**: Concise steps for setup, with prerequisites and basic examples.
- **SDK Reference**: Detailed TypeScript SDK docs with methods, parameters, and usage examples.
- **Configuration Templates**: Ready-to-use boilerplate for auth, subscriptions, and admin configs.
- **Migration Procedures**: Automated scripts with instructions for dev-to-staging-to-prod flows.
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues, error codes, and resolution steps.
- **Code Generation Templates**: Patterns for AI to generate consistent code, like auth hooks or API clients.
- **Additional Details**: Package as a private NPM module or Git repo. Include examples in multiple languages if needed.

This section establishes standards to ensure high-quality, consistent development practices.
