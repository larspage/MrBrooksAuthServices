# 1. Project Overview

## Project Name
MrBrooksAuthService

## Project Description
MrBrooksAuthService is a standalone, multi-tenant authentication and subscription management service designed to provide centralized user authentication, authorization, and membership management for a suite of SaaS applications under Mr Brooks LLC. This service leverages Supabase for robust authentication and database management, integrates seamlessly with Stripe for payment processing, and includes a comprehensive admin portal for managing applications, membership tiers, and pricing across multiple products. The system is built to support AI-driven development, ensuring modular components that can be developed in parallel by AI agents.

Key aspects include:
- Centralized authentication to reduce redundancy across applications.
- Multi-tenant architecture for handling multiple applications securely.
- Subscription management with flexible tiers and bundling options.
- Admin tools for easy configuration and oversight.

## Problem Statement
Managing authentication, authorization, and subscription billing across multiple SaaS applications introduces significant complexity, security risks, and development overhead. Without a centralized service, each application would require its own authentication system, user management, and payment processing mechanisms, leading to duplicated efforts, inconsistent user experiences, potential security vulnerabilities, and increased maintenance costs. This service addresses these issues by providing a unified platform that streamlines integration, enhances security, and simplifies administration.

## Primary Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Mr Brooks LLC (sole employee/owner) - Responsible for overall system administration, application integration, and business oversight.
- **Secondary**: End users of the various SaaS applications - Benefit from seamless authentication and subscription experiences.
- **Tertiary**: AI development systems - Utilize standardized APIs and documentation for automated application integration and development.

This section serves as the foundational overview for the entire project, guiding all subsequent development phases.

## Modular Development Breakdown
This breakdown provides simple, modular tasks to implement aspects related to the project overview. These tasks are designed for parallel AI agent development, with checkboxes for tracking progress as a living document. Each task is atomic and focuses on minimal dependencies.

### Initial Setup Tasks
- [x] Set up the project repository in GitHub with initial structure (e.g., folders for src, docs, tests).
- [x] Create a README.md file summarizing the project name, description, and problem statement.
- [x] Document primary stakeholders in a stakeholders.md file or section within README.md.
- [x] Initialize package.json for Node.js-based components, including dependencies for Supabase and Stripe.

### Documentation and Planning Tasks
- [ ] Expand project description into a detailed vision document, including diagrams of high-level architecture.
- [ ] Analyze problem statement and create a risk assessment checklist for potential development overheads.
- [ ] Define stakeholder requirements gathering process, including templates for feedback collection.
- [ ] Set up a project wiki or docs folder for ongoing living documentation updates.

### Integration Preparation Tasks
- [ ] Research and document initial Supabase setup steps for authentication.
- [ ] Outline Stripe integration prerequisites, such as account setup and API key management.
- [ ] Plan admin portal wireframes based on stakeholder needs.
- [ ] Create a modular task list for multi-tenant features, breaking down into database schema tasks.

Update this checklist as tasks are completed or new ones are identified during development.
