# 14. Compliance and Regulatory

## Legal Requirements
Ensure all legal aspects are covered to protect the business and users.

- **Privacy Policy**: Detailed document outlining data collection, use, sharing, and protection practices.
- **Terms of Service**: Clear agreement on usage rules, billing terms, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution.
- **Data Processing Agreements**: Contracts with processors (e.g., Supabase, Stripe) compliant with GDPR requirements.
- **Cookie Policy**: Explain cookie usage, types (essential, analytics), and consent mechanisms.
- **Additional Details**: Make policies accessible via footer links. Update annually or with major changes, with version history.

## Regulatory Compliance
Adhere to key regulations for user data protection.

- **GDPR (European Users)**:
  - Establish lawful basis for processing (e.g., consent, contract).
  - Implement consent management with granular options and withdrawal.
  - Support data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure).
  - Define data breach notification procedures within 72 hours.
- **CCPA (California Users)**:
  - Provide privacy rights disclosures in policies.
  - Enable data access, deletion, and opt-out requests.
  - Implement "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" links where applicable.
- **Additional Details**: Conduct compliance audits. Use tools for consent management like Cookiebot. Prepare for other regs like CPRA or international equivalents.

## Geographic Considerations
Address location-specific needs for global accessibility.

- **Data Residency**: Offer options for data storage in specific regions (e.g., EU servers for GDPR).
- **International Payments**: Support multi-currency via Stripe, with automatic conversion.
- **Regional Compliance**: Framework to add compliance for new regions (e.g., Brazil's LGPD).
- **Additional Details**: Monitor legal changes with subscriptions to updates. Implement geolocation-based features for compliance prompts.
