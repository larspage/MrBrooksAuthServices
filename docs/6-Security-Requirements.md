# 6. Security Requirements

## Authentication Methods
The service supports multiple secure authentication options to accommodate diverse user needs while maintaining high security standards.

- **Email/Password**: Standard registration with password hashing (using bcrypt or Argon2), email verification links, and rate limiting on attempts.
- **Social Logins**: Integration with providers like Google, GitHub, Facebook, Apple, and Discord, using OAuth 2.0 protocols.
- **Magic Links**: Passwordless authentication via time-limited email links, with optional device recognition.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Support for TOTP (e.g., Google Authenticator), with backup codes and recovery options.
- **Enterprise SSO**: Future support for SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect for organizational logins.
- **Additional Details**: All methods include session fixation prevention and secure cookie handling. Implement account lockout after repeated failures.

## Authorization Framework
Authorization ensures users access only permitted resources, with granular controls.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define roles like 'user', 'admin', 'app_owner' per application.
- **Permission System**: Fine-grained permissions (e.g., 'read:profile', 'write:subscription') assignable to roles.
- **API Security**: All APIs require valid JWTs with claims validation; use short-lived tokens (15min) with refresh tokens.
- **Session Management**: Secure sessions with HTTP-only cookies, automatic logout on inactivity, and multi-device support.
- **Additional Details**: Implement attribute-based access control (ABAC) for complex scenarios. Use libraries like CASL for permission checks.

## Data Protection and Compliance
Ensure data handling complies with international standards, protecting user privacy.

- **GDPR Compliance**:
  - User data export in machine-readable format (JSON/CSV).
  - Right to deletion with cascading removal from all systems.
  - Consent management for marketing and data processing.
  - Data processing agreements with third parties (e.g., Supabase, Stripe).
- **CCPA Compliance**:
  - Clear privacy policy disclosures.
  - Opt-out mechanisms for data sharing.
  - User rights for data access and correction.
- **Additional Details**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Conduct regular data protection impact assessments (DPIAs). Include breach notification protocols within 72 hours.

## Security Testing and Monitoring
Proactive measures to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

- **Automated Security Scanning**: Integrate tools like Snyk or OWASP ZAP in CI/CD pipelines.
- **Penetration Testing**: Schedule quarterly tests by certified third parties, focusing on auth and payment flows.
- **Audit Logging**: Log all security events (logins, permission changes) in an immutable log, with retention for 1 year.
- **Incident Response**: Documented plan with roles, communication templates, and post-incident reviews.
- **Additional Details**: Set up real-time monitoring with alerts for anomalies (e.g., unusual login patterns). Use SIEM tools for log analysis.

This section details security measures to protect the system, users, and data, aligning with best practices.

## Modular Development Breakdown
Modular tasks for implementing security features, suitable for parallel AI development with progress tracking.

### Authentication Tasks
- [ ] Implement email/password auth with hashing and verification.
- [ ] Integrate social login providers using Supabase Auth.
- [ ] Set up magic link functionality with expiration.
- [ ] Add MFA with TOTP and backup codes.
- [ ] Plan SSO integration stubs for future expansion.

### Authorization Tasks
- [ ] Define RBAC models in the database.
- [ ] Implement permission checking library.
- [ ] Create JWT issuance and validation endpoints.
- [ ] Set up session management with secure cookies.
- [ ] Add inactivity timeout and logout features.

### Compliance Tasks
- [ ] Build data export functionality for GDPR.
- [ ] Implement deletion cascades for right to be forgotten.
- [ ] Create consent management UI and database.
- [ ] Document privacy policy and opt-out mechanisms.
- [ ] Set up breach notification workflows.

### Testing and Monitoring Tasks
- [ ] Integrate automated scanning in CI/CD.
- [ ] Schedule and document penetration testing plans.
- [ ] Implement audit logging with triggers.
- [ ] Develop incident response documentation.
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts for security events.

Update this checklist as security features are implemented or refined.
