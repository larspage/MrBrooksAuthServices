# 18. Future Considerations

## Planned Features for Future Iterations
Outline features to enhance the service post-launch.

- **Advanced Analytics**: Implement detailed user behavior tracking, revenue forecasts, and custom reports.
- **Enterprise Features**: Add SSO, advanced user management, and compliance reporting tools.
- **Mobile SDK**: Develop native SDKs for iOS and Android integration.
- **API Rate Limiting**: Introduce usage-based limiting with analytics on API consumption.
- **White-label Options**: Allow custom branding for different app suites.
- **Additional Details**: Prioritize based on user feedback. Plan for quarterly feature releases.

## Scalability Planning
Strategies to handle growth.

- **Database Scaling**: Add read replicas and sharding for high load.
- **Application Scaling**: Transition to microservices for independent scaling.
- **Geographic Expansion**: Deploy to multiple regions for low latency.
- **Integration Ecosystem**: Create plugin system for third-party services.
- **Additional Details**: Monitor usage to trigger scaling. Budget for cloud costs.

## Maintenance Approach
Ongoing maintenance to ensure longevity.

- **Regular Updates**: Monthly patches for security and bugs, quarterly features.
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuous monitoring and tuning.
- **Security Audits**: Quarterly reviews and pen testing.
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Update with changes, especially for AI integration.
- **Additional Details**: Set up automated update processes. Gather user input for improvements.
