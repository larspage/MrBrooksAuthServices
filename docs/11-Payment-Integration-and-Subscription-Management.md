# 11. Payment Integration and Subscription Management

## Stripe Integration
Integrate Stripe for secure, scalable payment processing.

- **Products and Pricing**: Dynamically create Stripe products and prices via API for each membership tier and bundle.
- **Subscription Management**: Handle full lifecycle including creation, updates, cancellations, and pauses.
- **Payment Methods**: Support credit cards, digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay), and bank transfers.
- **Webhooks**: Set up endpoints to handle real-time events like payment success, failure, or subscription renewals.
- **Additional Details**: Use Stripe Elements for PCI-compliant payment forms. Implement test mode for development with mock data.

## Billing Features
Comprehensive features for smooth billing operations.

- **Automatic Recurring Billing**: Manage monthly and yearly cycles with automatic charges and renewals.
- **Proration**: Calculate and apply prorated charges for upgrades, downgrades, or mid-cycle changes.
- **Failed Payment Handling**:
  - Retry logic with configurable attempts and exponential backoff.
  - Send email notifications for failures and upcoming retries.
  - Implement grace periods (e.g., 7 days) before suspension.
- **Invoice Management**: Generate, customize, and send invoices automatically, with PDF downloads.
- **Tax Calculation**: Use Stripe Tax for automatic calculation, collection, and remittance based on user location.
- **Additional Details**: Support refunds and credits. Include billing history views in user and admin portals.

## Bundle Management
Flexible bundling for cross-application subscriptions.

- **All-Inclusive Memberships**: Create bundles grouping multiple applications with unified pricing.
- **Bundle Types**:
  - Static: Fixed set of applications.
  - Dynamic: Automatically include new applications based on rules.
  - Selective: Allow admins to choose specific applications.
- **Pricing Strategy**: Offer discounts for bundles (e.g., 20% off individual prices), with tiered options.
- **Additional Details**: Sync bundle subscriptions with individual ones to avoid overlaps. Provide APIs for bundle creation and assignment.
