# MrBrooksAuthService

A standalone, multi-tenant authentication and subscription management service designed to provide centralized user authentication, authorization, and membership management for a suite of SaaS applications under Mr Brooks LLC.

## Project Description

MrBrooksAuthService leverages Supabase for robust authentication and database management, integrates seamlessly with Stripe for payment processing, and includes a comprehensive admin portal for managing applications, membership tiers, and pricing across multiple products. The system is built to support AI-driven development, ensuring modular components that can be developed in parallel by AI agents.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Authentication**: Reduce redundancy across applications
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Handle multiple applications securely
- **Enhanced Redirect Validation**: Detailed error logging with configuration instructions
- **Comprehensive Membership Data**: All auth responses include membership information with pricing
- **Subscription Management**: Flexible tiers and bundling options
- **Admin Tools**: Easy configuration and oversight
- **AI-Friendly Development**: Modular, parallel-development ready

## Recent Enhancements

### Enhanced Authentication Features (January 2025)
The Auth Service has been significantly enhanced with improved redirect validation and comprehensive membership data in all authentication responses:

- **Smart Redirect Validation**: When invalid redirect URLs are used, the system now logs detailed error information to the [`audit_logs`](src/types/database.ts:225) table with specific SQL commands to fix the configuration
- **Rich Membership Responses**: All authentication endpoints ([`/api/auth/initiate`](src/app/api/auth/initiate/route.ts), [`/api/auth/complete`](src/app/api/auth/complete/route.ts), [`/api/auth/verify`](src/app/api/auth/verify/route.ts)) now return comprehensive user membership data including:
  - Application details and membership tiers
  - Expiration dates and renewal information
  - Pricing data (monthly/yearly costs)
  - Membership status and features

ðŸ“– **Documentation**: See [Enhanced Auth Service Features](docs/enhanced-auth-service-features.md) for detailed implementation guide and [Architecture Decision Record](docs/decisions/2025-01-19-enhanced-auth-service-with-membership-data.md) for technical decisions.

## Problem Statement

Managing authentication, authorization, and subscription billing across multiple SaaS applications introduces significant complexity, security risks, and development overhead. This service addresses these issues by providing a unified platform that streamlines integration, enhances security, and simplifies administration.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with built-in authentication)
- **Payments**: Stripe integration
- **Infrastructure**: DigitalOcean
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
